        :markdown
          CloudApp allows you to share **images**, **links**, **music**, **videos** and **files**. Here is how it works: choose a file, drag it to the menubar and let us take care of the rest. We provide you with a short link automatically copied to your clipboard that you can use to share your upload with co-workers and friends.

          Additionally you can **view**, **track** and **delete** files right from your menubar.

          **Drag and drop** files directly from Finder, define a **hotkey** to trigger an upload of a file or **screenshot** and **print** to CloudApp from any application on your Mac.

        :markdown
          CloudApp allows you to share, access and organize your uploads from anywhere in the world through an intuitive **web interface**.

          You can upload images on the go with our image uploader for the iPhone available soon on the iTunes **App Store**.

          If that's not enough, use the same **API** our apps use to view and manage your uploads.

        :markdown
          CloudApp is powered by [Heroku](http://heroku.com) and Amazon's [Simple Storage Service](http://aws.amazon.com/s3). Files are redundantly stored on multiple devices across multiple storage facilities preventing data corruption and loss.

          You can sleep well at night knowing your files are safe.

        :markdown
          CloudApp ships with a range of plugins called **Raindrops** allowing you to extend functionality to your favorite applications for the Mac.

          Download Raindrops for **iPhoto**, **iTunes**, **Photoshop** and many more.

          Third-party developers can use the same technologies used by CloudApp's built-in functionality for their own applications.
