          CloudApp allows you to share **images**, **links**, **music**, **videos** and **files**. Here is how it works: choose a file, drag it to the menubar and let us take care of the rest. We provide you with a short link automatically copied to your clipboard that you can use to share your upload with co-workers and friends.

          Additionally you can **view**, **track** and **delete** files right from your menubar.

          **Drop** files from your Desktop or any Finder window or use the **hotkey** to quickly share the latest entry from your clipboard. Check out the [getting started guide](http://start.getcloudapp.com) for all the details.

          The [CloudApp web app](http://my.cl.ly) is the tool of choice for when you need to see more than your last 5 drops and is designed to compliment the Mac app. The Mac app does only what you need most of the time and the web app takes over from there.

          If that's not enough, [use the same API](http://developer.getcloudapp.com/) our apps use to build anything your heart desires.

        :markdown
          CloudApp is powered by [Heroku](http://heroku.com) and Amazon's [Simple Storage Service](http://aws.amazon.com/s3). Files are redundantly stored on multiple devices across multiple storage facilities preventing data corruption and loss.

          You can sleep well at night knowing your files are safe.

          CloudApp ships with a wide range of plugins called **Raindrops** allowing you to share using CloudApp without leaving your favorite Mac apps.

          There's a Raindrop to share pictures from **iPhoto**, bookmark the page in **Safari**, the canvas you're working on in **Photoshop**, and many more.

          If you're a developer, add functionality for your own or your favorite Mac applications using the [Raindrop API](http://developer.getcloudapp.com/raindrops).
